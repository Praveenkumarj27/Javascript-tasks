// Difference between react and angular?
//      React is a library, but Angular is a full-fledged framework. 
// The virtual DOM and one-way data binding are used by React.js,but the real DOM and two-way data binding 
// are used by Angular. There's also a speed difference (React's is faster) and a difference in bundle size 
// (React's is smaller).

// Difference between npm and npx?
//        NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is installed  when NodeJS is installed and  
// comes with a command-line interface (CLI), used to interact with the NPM database, that hosts public
// and private packages.
//        NPX stands for Node Package eXecute and like NPM, it is installed when we get NodeJS. 
// It is basically a NPM package runner,which allows us to run JavaScript packages without installing it.That means 
// that if you only need to use something just once NPX is perfect,and package pollution is not a concern.
